# Student Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project 
Author - Bhagyashree Pise 

## About the Project
The **Student Performance Dashboard** is an interactive analytics project built using Microsoft Power BI.  
It visualizes and analyzes academic performance data of students to help educators understand trends and factors affecting scores. 
The dashboard transforms raw student data into meaningful insights through KPIs, slicers, and multiple Power BI visual types. 

## Files in Repository 
- Dataset File: 'StudentsPerformance.xlsx'
- Power BI File: 'Student's Performance Dashboard.pbix'
- Dashboard screenshot: 'dashboard.png' 

### Key Data Fields Used
- Gender  
- Ethnicity Groups (Group A to Group E)  
- Test Preparation Status  
- Lunch Type  
- Subject Scores:
  - Math
  - Reading
  - Writing

## What the Dashboard Analyzes
This dashboard helps to evaluate:

- Overall student performance  
- Average scores across subjects  
- Impact of external factors like:
  - Test preparation
  - Lunch type
  - Ethnicity
  - Gender differences

## Visuals Implemented
The dashboard includes the following components:

###  KPIs
- **Total Students:** 1009  
- **Average Score:** 67.79  
- Subject-wise averages:
  - Math: 66.15  
  - Reading: 69.11  
  - Writing: 68.11  
- Lunch-wise averages:
  - Standard Lunch Avg Score: 72  
  - Free/Reduced Lunch Avg Score: 63
 
### Charts and Tables
- Gender slicer (Male / Female)
- Test Preparation slicer (Completed / None)
- Lunch slicer (Standard / Free-Reduced)
- Bar chart: *Impact of Test Preparation on Scores (by Gender)*
- Treemap: *Number of Students Across Ethnicity Groups*
- Column chart: *Gender Differences Across Grade Categories* 
- Table visual: **Top 5 Students by Average Score**

## Major Insights
From the analysis: 
- **Female Students Slightly Outperform Males**
  - Female Avg Score: 70  
  - Male Avg Score: 66
  
- Students who completed test preparation scored higher than those with no preparation.

- Lunch type has a noticeable effect:
  - Students with standard lunch perform better on average.

- Treemap shows the distribution of students is highest in Ethnicity Group C, followed by Group D.

## Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases:
- Power BI data modeling  
- Creating calculated columns  
- Writing custom DAX (Data Analysis Expression) measures  
- Designing interactive dashboards  
- Use of slicers and filters  
- Combining different visual types for clean layout

## How to Run the Project
1. Download the repository files.
2. Open 'Student's Performance Dashboard.pbix' in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. Ensure 'StudentsPerformance.xlsx' is in the same path or reconnect the data source.
4. Use slicers to explore insights interactively.

## Purpose 
This project demonstrates practical PowerBI skills.
It is part of my Data Analytics Portfolio.
